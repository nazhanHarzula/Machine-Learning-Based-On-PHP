# Machine Learning Based On PHP

This project will carry out a machine learning process but is based on PHP programming. Then the package to be used is PHP-ML - Machine Learning library for PHP `https://php-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`. This package provides several functions in the machine learning process, but it is still not good enough compared to coding in Python-based programming. This library provides Algorithms, Cross Validation, Neural Network, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction and much more in one library.

<b>Requires</b>
<ul>
  <li>PHP >= 7.1</li>
  <li>Installing composer  `https://getcomposer.org/download/`</li>
  <li>Installing library : `composer require php-ai/php-ml`</li>
</ul>  
<i>After all the requirements have been fulfilled, we can carry out the machine learning process directly on our system</i>
